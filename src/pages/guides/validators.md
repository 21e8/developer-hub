## Overview

Validators are responsible for processing transactions, generating new blocks, and validating the state of the blockchain to ensure accuracy and prevent double-spending. They participate in the consensus mechanism by voting on the legitimacy of blocks proposed by other validators, which helps to maintain the integrity and security of the network. Validators also contribute to the network's decentralization by staking their SOL tokens, which aligns their incentives with the network's health and stability.

Validators often participate in governance decisions, providing insights and voting on proposals that affect the network's future. Many validators also contribute to the community by offering educational resources, running community nodes, and supporting the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and tools that enhance the ecosystem.
